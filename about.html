        Established 
        Scotland is the home of the deep fried food and is loved by near enough the population 
        as a whole. A staple food source for a long time, with classics such as battered cod, haddock,
        black pudding, white pudding, red pudding and other food stuffs.
        <br /><br />
        Recent developments in the art of deep frying has lead to other food stuff being deep fried,
        such a pizza, mars bars, double deckers and a whole host of different chocolate items.
        We were one of the first chippy's to start this up in Scotland.
        <br /><br />
        Although the food is deep fried (see warning on home page), all of the packaging we use
        is recyclable, keeping up with our ethos on being better for the environment. We do offer
        a healthy option for our punters, where after they consume our food on premises, they can
        jump on a training cycle and burn off what they eat, which in turn can power our facilities
        for a while lowering our carbon footprint and energy consumption from natural resources - as
        we really do care about the environment, as well as the health of our punters.
